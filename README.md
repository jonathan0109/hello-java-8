## About The Project

We’ll have a quick look at some of the most interesting new features in Java 8.

### Collections Framework

Any group of individual objects that are represented as a single unit is known as a Java Collection of Objects.

A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.

java.util.Collection is the root interface of Collections Framework.

Some other important interfaces are java.util.List, java.util.Set, java.util.Queue and java.util.Map. The Map is the only interface that doesn’t inherit from the Collection interface but it’s part of the Collections framework.
